# Purpose

This is a personal script that queries my fieldbook Pantry sheet to report on
which food items are about to expire soon.

It very much depends on the exact structure of the sheets and fields; as such,
it's really only meant to work for me, personally. If you're interested in
using this too, let me know and I'll help you out. :)

# Configuration

- `ENV['FIELDBOOK_KEY']`
- `ENV['FIELDBOOK_SECRET']`
- `ENV['FIELDBOOK_BOOK_ID']`
- `ENV['FIELDBOOK_SHEET_NAME']`
